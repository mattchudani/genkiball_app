# Environmental Awareness App

## Description

Our app is designed to raise awareness about environmental issues, such as the pollution in the Ala Wai area, and to offer a proven solution for communities facing similar challenges. The app features two main components: a map and a point system.

- **Map:** Displays key locations to educate users about specific spots and provides additional information about surrounding areas, including runoff data that might affect streams leading to these locations.
- **Point System:** Introduces a competitive element, encouraging users and organizations to participate and engage with the app in a fun and meaningful way.

## Inspiration

The inspiration for our app came from the Genki Ala Wai project, which successfully tested Genki balls in Hawaii's Salt Lake area. This motivated us to create an app that not only raises awareness about pollution in the Ala Wai but also addresses similar environmental issues in other areas.

## Technical Challenges

One of the main technical challenges we encountered was selecting a suitable database that would incur no costs. After trying various options, we settled on SQLite, even though it was primarily designed for local data storage. We used it to store public data for the points system and compile a leaderboard. Integrating SQLite into our app was particularly challenging due to our lack of prior experience with it.

## Future Improvements

In a future version of our app, we would like to:
- Introduce a sign-up or scheduling feature to facilitate group activities, such as making and deploying Genki balls in the Ala Wai or other locations.
- Consider replacing SQLite with a more suitable database solution.
- Explore the possibility of porting the app to mobile platforms.
